- 👋 Hi, I’m @virgin-User
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to modify the bot for D2R - created by aeon0 - but I have to learn how to code as I go.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python 3.7 (latest)
- 💞️ I’m looking for a bit of help sometimes  :)
- 📫 How to reach me ... I have no idea what to put here, privacy and all.
